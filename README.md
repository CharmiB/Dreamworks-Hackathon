# Dreamworks-Hackathon

This is for the Dreamworks hackathon in which I was a participant.

Completed upto level 3, which involved creation of particle motion, collision with the ground, splitting them randomly and collision with one basic 3D object (Cube).

To see the demo please open index.html

Works best on Morzilla Firefox.
